We're really happy that you're considering joining us! Here's a challenge that will help us understand your test troubleshooting and debugging skills.

## Details

This is a small [webdriver.io](https://webdriver.io) automation project that attempts to automate some scenarios of the login and registration flows for the [open demo cart](https://demo.opencart.com/) project.

## Instructions

There are at least 3 tests that are currently not working as expected (i.e. they are failing). Your responsibility is to make them all green (pass). _Note: There could be more than 3 tests broken at the moment of your review, so make sure you fix as many as possible._

### Before you start

1. Make sure you have a compatible version of Node.js installed. We recommend using Node.js v12 or v14.
2. Make sure to read the webdriver.io [getting started](https://webdriver.io/docs/gettingstarted.html) instructions, in case you are not familiar with the framework.
3. Fork this repository so you can make changes to it locally.

### Running the project

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

### What else?

The instructions are simple – fix the broken tests. However, if you run into issues during setup or are unable to run the tests, feel free to take one of the following paths:

1. Start a fresh project using a framework of your choice and try to automate the same scenarios.
2. Send us a report with the problems you encounter and why you were not able to run the tests. Be as detailed as possible – let us know what problems you found, what you did do to troubleshoot them, and what you would do for a possible solution for this automation project.

## What we expect to see

When you're finished, you can either commit your changes and send a link to download your forked project – or, zip the project and send directly to **lauren@hoodoo.digital**.
