We're really happy that you're considering to join us! Here's a challenge that will help us understand your test troubleshoorting and debugging skills.

## Details

The current project contains a small [webdriver.io](https://webdriver.io) automation project that attempts to automate some scenarios of the login and register flows for the [open demo cart](https://demo.opencart.com/) project.

## Instructions

There are at least 3 tests that are currently not working as expected (i.e they are failing), your responsability is to make them all green. _Note: There could be more than 3 tests broke at the moment of your review, so make sure you can fix as many as possible._

### Before you start

1. Make sure you have a compatible version of NodeJs installed. We recommend using NodeJs v12 or v14.
2. Make sure to read the webdriver.io [getting started](https://webdriver.io/docs/gettingstarted.html) instructions. (In case you are not familiar with the frameworks).
3. You could either fork this repository and send the link to us or download it and then send it zip it to **lauren@hoodoo.digital**.

### Running the project

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

### What else?

The instructions are simple, but we are aware that the framework might not work for you, so if you enconter issues with the current solution feel free to take one of the following paths:

1. Start a fresh project using any framework of your choice and try to automate the same scenarios.
2. Send us a report with the problems you enconter and why you were not able to run the tests. Try to be as detailed as possible, let us know what problems you found, what did you do to troubleshoot them and finally what is a possible solution for this automation project.

## What we expect to see
